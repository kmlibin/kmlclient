      I often get asked, "Did you always want to code?" And honestly, you'd
      think I would have, considering my parents spent their careers in tech and
      my brother's idea of a good time as kids was building computers (he’s in DevOps
      now, of course). But instead of following the family tradition, I guess I
      was determined to be different? With a love for puzzles, writing, and
      research, I went off to earn an MA in History. For many years, I was fully
      immersed in research, critical thinking, and uncovering the backstories of
      our world...but I wasn’t quite sure where to take that knowledge career-wise.

      For a while, I taught Information Literacy and History courses at the
      university level, enjoying the flexibility it offered as I supported my
      husband’s globe-trotting career on the national triathlon team.
      Eventually, he retired from professional racing and took on a full-time
      job, which gave me the chance to rethink my own path. Strangely enough, I
      came back to coding — maybe it really is in my DNA! Now, instead of
      digging through archives, I solve puzzles in code, building websites that
      help small businesses bring their vision to life.

      Freelancing has been a rewarding path; I know the challenges small
      businesses face, and I enjoy crafting affordable, flexible solutions that
      make them stand out. Working one-on-one with clients allows me to help
      them thrive, while still keeping that creative problem-solving element I
      loved in both history and teaching.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me running (and
      occasionally tripping) on our local mountain trails, trying out new baking
      experiments that may or may not end in disaster, buying toys my cats won’t
      play with, or getting lost in a good biography.
